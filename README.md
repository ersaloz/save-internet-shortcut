## What it does

Save current URL as old plain Internet Shortcut file (.url).

## How it works

To launch the save dialog press Ctrl+Shift+F12.

Default filename is URL hostname; you can edit freely. Keep 'url' as file extension to benefit from shorcut behavior in systems where that hints a registered file type.

Default save folder is ~/Downloads, but you can navigate from here.

## Why it is different

Draws upon extensions with similar aim, now defunct and/or encumbered with extra functionality:

SaveLink [https://legacycollector.org/firefox-addons/14019/index.html] --obsolete as of 2019-08-20

SaveAsURL [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/saveasurl/] --also saves a screenshot; as of 2019-08-20 not up to Firefox stable

## Status

Not yet mature to go public. By now, just for private use.
